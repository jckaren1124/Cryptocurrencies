# Cryptocurrencies

The purpose of this analysis is to gain insight on cryptocurrencies in order to build a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio.  Since no clear pattern is known in advance, unsupervised machine learning is utilized to visualize clusters of data.  The crypto data was first cleaned and filtered to only include relevant information needed for the analysis.  Columns with string data were then transformed into numeric data and scaled to prevent skewed results, which is a necessary requirement for unsupervised machine learning models.  The statistical technique of principal component analysis was applied to reduce the large dataset into a smaller and more concise form.  The K-means algorithm and elbow curve were then used to determine the cluster number.  The creation of scatter plots showed the clusters in 3-D form.  Then, a new table with tradable crypotocurrencies was generated, and the "Total Coin Supply" and "Total Coins Mined" columns were scaled and plotted in a separate graph.
